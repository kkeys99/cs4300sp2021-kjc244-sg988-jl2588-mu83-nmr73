Yet despite all these extreme circumstances Rusty Quill has managed to stand tall and we wanted to say thank you to everyone who has made this possible.Here at Rusty Towers, we started the year hoping for convention appearances and maybe some international travel; instead, we pivoted to fully remote working to keep all your favourite shows ticking along safely and launched new online content like the Enthusigasm podcast and our Twitch live streams. Not only that, we have continued donating towards the Covid Relief Fund every month and with your additional help through Gaming and Giving we have raised more than \u00a355,000 pounds to charity this year. That is astounding.We are incredibly grateful to have such a skilled and dedicated team working with us and persevering through this year. But we never would have been able to make it anywhere near this far without the direct support of you, the listeners.\u00a0You\u2019ve trusted us through thick and thin and thanks to you, we\u2019ve managed to not only weather this year but even keep growing and start spinning up a load of new and exciting projects that you can look forward to in 2021. Your support has sustained the livelihoods of everyone here at Rusty Towers despite so much hardship and I know I speak for everyone here when I say that we will never forget your generosity and will continue to work to uphold the faith you show in us.As always, we have special holiday content running throughout the festive period to help put a spring in your step and even have a complete music album for Stellar Firma fans being released to public from the 25th of December through to the New Year\u2019s Eve.We hope you and all your loved ones are happy and healthy this holiday. You are all amazing, truly amazing, and you all deserve the best new year possible.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much, and happy holidays.\u00a0Join our community:WEBSITE: rustyquill.comFACEBOOK: facebook.com/therustyquillTWITTER: @therustyquillREDDIT: reddit.com/r/RustyQuillDISCORD: https://discord.gg/KckTv8yEMAIL: mail@rustyquill.com  \u00a0See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.", "duration_ms": 108173, "genres": ["Arts & Entertainment", "Stories"], "publisher": "Rusty Quill", "release_date": "2020-12-24", "show_rank": "1"}, {"id": "7f3104TpeaLg9zNI47YhPt", "show_id": "5pwBAjuJJAOt7cED5Lkjnk", "name": "MAG Twilight Abyss - Part 3", "description": "The view from the rooftops of Slyde World is bleak.

How does an everyday person turn into a thief, a cult leader, or a scammer? Instead of portraying criminals as distinctly \u201cother,\u201d we explore our similarities and reveal the dark potential lurking inside of all of us. The Opportunist will launch with an episodic series on Sherry Shriner, a midwest mom and life-long church goer turned internet cult leader. The series follows Sherry as she gains thousands of followers online by promoting her own religion (a blend of biblical doomsday predictions and popular alien/reptilian conspiracy theories) and profits on selling spiritual weapons that defeat aliens and demons. As she rises to the status of infallible goddess, she leaves a trail of death and destruction in her wake. We speak with family & friends of deceased cult members, prosecutors, police officers, a high profile cult expert and more. Through thought-provoking interviews and investigative reporting, The Opportunist invites the listener along with us on a thrilling journey of discovery.

Odom talks about studying Cooke's voice, hearing Burr's song \"Wait for It\" for the first time, and how the musical 'Rent' inspired him as a teen. Odom is nominated for two Oscars \u2014 for his role as Sam Cooke and for his original song, \"Speak Now.\" In the dark comedy 'Promising Young Woman,' Cassie (Carey Mulligan) works at a coffee shop by day, and hunts sexual predators by night. She goes to bars, pretends to be falling down drunk \u2014 and then confronts the men who try to take advantage of her. Cassie is avenging the death of her best friend, who, the movie implies, has died by suicide after being raped at medical school.

Yet despite all these extreme circumstances Rusty Quill has managed to stand tall and we wanted to say thank you to everyone who has made this possible.Here at Rusty Towers, we started the year hoping for convention appearances and maybe some international travel; instead, we pivoted to fully remote working to keep all your favourite shows ticking along safely and launched new online content like the Enthusigasm podcast and our Twitch live streams.

In asking patients why, he learned that they were plagued by what they called \u201cparts.\u201d These patients became his teachers as they described how their parts formed networks of inner relationships that resembled the families he had been working with. He also found that as they focused on and, thereby, separated from their parts, they would shift into a state characterized by qualities like curiosity, calm, confidence, and compassion. He called that inner essence the Self and was amazed to find it even in severely diagnosed and traumatized patients. From these explorations, the\u00a0Internal Family Systems\u00a0(IFS) model was born in the early 1980s.IFS is now evidence-based and has become a widely-used form of psychotherapy, particularly with trauma. It provides a non-pathologizing, optimistic, and empowering perspective and a practical and effective set of techniques for working with individuals, couples, families, and\u2014more recently\u2014corporations and classrooms.Please enjoy!This episode is brought to you by\u00a0LinkedIn Jobs.\u00a0Whether you are looking to hire now for a critical role or thinking about needs that you may have in the future,\u00a0LinkedIn Jobs\u00a0can help.

It\u2019sfrustrating when you\u2019re trying to tell someone something and they just won\u2019t listen, but what about all the times you\u2019ve been distracted in a conversation? There are a handful of reasons\u00a0why humans aren\u2019t great at listening, but the benefits to becoming a true listener are off the charts.\u00a0Better connections, more trust, and happier relationships\u00a0just to tout a few.In her book,\u00a0Listen Like You Mean It,\u00a0Ximena Vengoechea\u00a0talks about why listening is so important, and why we often get it wrong.\u00a0Being a great listener\u00a0is almost like having a super-power, you\u2019ll be able to\u00a0tell what a person wants and needs\u00a0faster and more accurately. This can help in almost any business, but especially in a people-first business like\u00a0real estate when you\u2019re constantly talking to tenants, management, sellers, buyers, or\u00a0agents.Ximena goes through the\u00a03 qualities that are most needed\u00a0when becoming a great listener and how you can put yourself into\u00a0\u201clistening mode\u201d.\u00a0She also walks through\u00a0how to have difficult conversations\u00a0or conversations with people who aren\u2019t the best listeners, plus what you can do to make sure that the person talking to you really feels heard.

What happens when you\u2019re hit with a $16,000 bill to fix a sewer, or when 20 of your tenants call you all at once with problems? Some things, like those examples, make active real estate investors envy passive investors. This is why Tamar Hermes decided to go on a more passive route for real estate investing.\u00a0Tamar started at age 28, working as an executive in the television industry. She realized that she was trading her time for money, and without her job, she wouldn\u2019t be able to pay her bills. So, she put 10% down on a duplex and started house hacking. Over time she bought more and more duplexes, some even out of her 401(k). She was an aspiring landlord, but after being hit with the situations above, she decided to sell all her units in Los Angeles and put her money into more passive income streams.Now she\u2019s invested in syndications, like Brandon\u2019s Open Door Capital to be exact. This gives her far more freedom to pursue her passions in life, without having to worry about those 2 A.M. toilet calls. Tamar refers to herself as a very cautious investor, and that may be why she feels far more diversified with passive investing than active investing.She also talks through \u201cfinding your tribe\u201d and how Gobundance has helped her meet friends and partners within the real estate space. This doesn\u2019t mean you need to go out and find a group, but having friends and allies within your certain niche can help move you miles ahead of the competition!In This Episode We Cover:Using house hacking as a way to fuel your real estate investing\u00a0The difference between passive and active real estate investingFinding cash flow AND appreciation when looking for rental properties\u201cUpgrading your investing\u201d and growing your investor mindsetRecourse vs non-recourse loansFinding quality agents, certified financial planners, and other partnersAnd SO much more!Links from the ShowBiggerPockets ForumsOpen Door CapitalTravel Nurse HousingGrant CardoneGoBundanceBiggerPockets BookstoreBiggerPockets Podcast 423: Who Not How: Stop Doing the Things You Hate, Free Up Time, Be Happier and Richer with Dan SullivanJosh Dorkin\u00a0Check the full show notes here: http://biggerpockets.com/show458       ", "duration_ms": 4003135, "genres": ["Business & Technology"], "publisher": "BiggerPockets", "release_date": "2021-04-08", "show_rank": "9"}, {"id": "7AjA9W1rnSkMyp1rjnjGfR", "show_id": "23JyccHPmQ8fzmpmnvQ6hR", "name": "457: How Thinking 5 Moves Ahead Can Make You Millions with Patrick Bet-David", "description": "         Some people are born into wealth, but none are born into success. Success needs to be earned, through pain, hard work, and perseverance.Patrick Bet-David\u00a0came to the United States during the Iranian Revolution of 1978, after already being a refugee in Germany. Patrick\u00a0served in the U.S. Army\u00a0and prided himself on his ability to party, but after a family health emergency, he decided enough was enough, and he became the\u00a0hard-working, driven man he is today.Now, a\u00a0successful businessman, media producer, best selling author, and CEO, Patrick has a lot of wisdom to share for young and aspiring businesspeople. One of his biggest lessons:\u00a0don\u2019t waste your pain. Patrick shows how the best of the best in business, sports, or any other field are consistently\u00a0putting themselves in positions where they have to fight to be the best. Patrick argues that even if you\u2019re the best basketball player in your high school, once you go to college you may be at the bottom of the list, and once you become the best in college, you may be stuck again at the bottom of the professional leagues. This means\u00a0you have to constantly change, adapt, and\u00a0improve yourself\u00a0to become the best of the best.We also talk about Patrick\u2019s book,\u00a0Your Next Five Moves\u00a0and how people who are masters in their skillset are\u00a0thinking at least five moves ahead of their competition. Want to buy a house? What are the next 5-10 moves you could make right now to get that done. Most people do a single step, stop because it\u2019s too hard, and leave it at that.

How do you even get to 100 units when it\u2019s already challenging enough to get one? That answer is simple: stack them slowly over time. That\u2019s exactly what today\u2019s guest, Erika Sleger, did. Erika heard about house hacking from a lecture in college, so once she graduated she decided to buy a fourplex, live in one unit, and rent out the others.She learnt some valuable skills from that first fourplex and later sold it for a nice profit, 1031 exchanged it into an 18 unit, and started collecting rent. From there, she used her equity on the 18 unit to buy a 64 unit. Another 16 units here, some more units there, and before she knew it Erika had over 120 rental units. She acquired all of these properties through 1031 exchanges and pulling cash out via refinances for down payments.Managing over 100 units isn\u2019t easy, it took Erika a while to find management that worked, and she was still managing her managers. Even with the best due diligence, Erika talks through the challenges of filling and managing so many units. That\u2019s why Erika sold her multifamily properties and moved her money into commercial real estate.Now she owns \u201camazon-proof\u201d commercial spaces for coffee shops, a daycare center, and even a car maintenance shop. These leases are triple net, and give her the flexibility to move wherever she wants in the world, without having to over-manage a property manager.

He\u2019s here today with his partner\u00a0Cesar Pina, to talk\u00a0real estate, seminars, and business.DJ Envy grew up in Queens, New York, and was neighbors with a successful DJ. After he heard\u00a0how much money DJs were making\u00a0in the city, he decided to start DJ-ing himself, and began\u00a0releasing mixtapes. As his success grew, he started working for a radio station and landed a morning show, which later became known as\u00a0The Breakfast Club.After buying his first house and later selling it due to a long commute,\u00a0Envy walked away with around $80,000. He was hooked, and knew that real estate was a long-term way for him to build his wealth and create success for him and his family. He started out\u00a0buying a house every year and selling it a year later, then\u00a0bought some homes in Detroit\u00a0for $15,000\u00a0that\u00a0sold for over $260,000! Envy wanted to get more into real estate, so he was introduced to Cesar.Cesar was\u00a0serving time in prison when he first learnt about real estate investing. Once he was released, he decided to jump in. He bought single family homes, then small multifamily homes, then went on to commercial buildings. Now, heowns more than 1,600 units\u00a0and\u00a0flips anywhere from 60 to 80 houses per year!

After she graduated from college she took jobs where she felt underappreciated and at some points, humiliated.

Yes, you heard that right, 38 doors in under two years!These rental properties allowed Rachel and her husband to retire, as they were making six-figure incomes solely from their properties alone. This didn\u2019t mean two years in she was still a rookie. Far from it actually. Rachel had to systematize her rental properties as much as she could within those two years so she could manage them long distance without having huge headaches along the way.Rachel shares some interesting stories, from turning a duplex into a short-term boarding home, to catching her property managers stealing over $6,000 from her.

Once distracted, our brains find it hard to let go of the new information we\u2019ve just learnt or seen. This is why the\u00a0constant\u00a0onslaught of emails, messages, texts, and phone calls\u00a0could be\u00a0killing our productivity\u00a0and creativity.\u00a0Cal Newport, author of\u00a0A World Without Email, has seen this first hand.Cal discusses something he likes to call \u201cHyperactive Hivemind Workflow\u201d, which is essentially what happens to our brains when we\u2019re\u00a0constantly being nudged by electronic messages. When you\u2019ve got your head down and are working hard on an important project, just a simple glance at an email can\u00a0spin everything out of whack.Here\u2019s the thing, this is happening to all of us, all the time. We are constantly monitoring our emails and messages, and by the mid afternoon,\u00a0we\u2019re out of energy. We\u2019ve exhausted all of our cognitive resources. But isn\u2019t it productive to check emails and respond to them quickly throughout the day? This is what Cal refers to as the \u201cfool\u2019s gold of busyness\u201d.Luckily, there are some ways to get us into a\u00a0more\u00a0productive state, without having a barrage of emails in our inbox. Cal talks about efficient meetings, Kanban boards, restricting ad hoc communication, having office hours, and\u00a0being intentional with your time and attention. While these small email responses may seem like just a minute here or a minute there, they actually eat up a huge part of our work life.In This Episode We Cover:Why we need to\u00a0limit our intake of email, messages, and other communication throughout the dayGetting your team to be\u00a0less ad hoc about communication\u00a0and more intentionalHaving a \u201cprocess and procedure first\u201d mindset\u00a0when starting a businessUnderstanding what the \u201cvital tasks\u201d are in your businessKnowing your\u00a0cognizant footprint\u00a0and having intentional attentionAnd\u00a0So\u00a0Much More!Links from the ShowBiggerPockets PodcastBiggerPockets book storeBrandon's InstagramDavid's InstagramBiggerPockets Podcast 330: How to Ditch Distractions and Get WAY More Done With Cal NewportClick here to check the full show notes: https://www.biggerpockets.com/show449       ", "duration_ms": 4434573, "genres": ["Business & Technology"], "publisher": "BiggerPockets", "release_date": "2021-03-07", "show_rank": "9"}, {"id": "71fNLjjToaX8YmdvvCOoB9", "show_id": "23JyccHPmQ8fzmpmnvQ6hR", "name": "448: The Lazy Person\u2019s Guide to Financial Freedom in Less Than 10 Years with Dion Mcneeley", "description": "         Busy people tend to be...busy, and often, real estate investing is one of the things that they \u201cjust don\u2019t have time for\u201d. If you feel that way, listen to today\u2019s guest, Dion Mcneeley as he describes his own system for buying real estate the \u201clazy\u201d way.\u00a0Dion was a police officer and a truck driving instructor, taking care of his kids as a single parent, and struggling to get ahead. He went from $89,000 in debt to becoming debt free and financially free, thanks to the help of rental properties, in just 10 years.\u00a0After buying his primary home, Dion heard of success in owning rental properties, so he decided to move out of his house and into an apartment to see if he fit as a landlord. He rented the house to his friend, who later moved out without notifying him. Dion tried to make landlording work with another tenant, but ended up being underwater on the house payments. This is when he found BiggerPockets and read Rich Dad Poor Dad.\u00a0What was Dion\u2019s mistake? He wasn\u2019t running his rental properties like a business. After upgrading his processes, he went on to buy and house hack a duplex. Then he bought another duplex as an investment, and another one, then another house hack duplex. Within just 6 years, he had 7 units and was raking in $2,700 a month in pure cash flow!Dion talks about the mistakes he made, why he prefers side-by-side duplexes, how he\u2019s located his properties for maximum asset protection, and goes into his amazing strategy for getting tenants to sign longer leases and raise their own rents.

What do you want to\u00a0accomplish in the next 3-5 years? When asked this question, most entrepreneurs give a pretty simplistic answer. Something like \u201cOh, we\u2019ll get more clients by this time next year\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll buy two more houses and then I\u2019ll be happy\u201d. How often do we\u00a0sit down and paint a picture of what we want our life to look like? Today we\u2019re discussing\u00a0Vivid Visions\u00a0with their creator\u00a0Cameron Herold.Cameron is a\u00a0veteran in the business world, he likes to say that he was \u201cgroomed\u201d by his entrepreneurial grandparents and father to become a success story. By the time Cameron was 21, he had a\u00a0full-on business that had 12 employees, and at 22 he bought his first\u00a0rental property. He later became a franchisee for College Pro Painters and was so successful that he went on to coach new franchisees.He\u2019s partnered with\u00a0hundred-million dollar companies, grown and sold businesses for millions, coached the\u00a0CEO of Sprint, a monarchy in the middle east, has written 5 books, and runs the\u00a0Second in Command Podcast, where he talks to successful COOs. Cameron is someone who clearly has accomplished a lot and has a TON of wisdom to share.Cameron has serious knowledge on\u00a0business management\u00a0and talks about the importance of the\u00a0CEO and COO relationship. Cameron describes how a COO needs to be a partner to the entrepreneur (the CEO) and operate as the\u00a0ying to the CEO\u2019s yang. If you\u2019ve heard the terms \u201cthe visionary and the innovator\u201d from books like\u00a0Traction, this is exactly what Cameron is talking about.If you\u2019ve been wondering where the idea of a \u201cplan\u201d or \u201cvision\u201d comes into play, Brandon, David, and Cameron all discuss their \u201cVivid Visions\u201d and how it\u2019s led them to success in their life. Cameron coined the term \u201cVivid Vision\u201d because most entrepreneurs were simply writing down a 1-2 sentence mission statement instead of\u00a0creating a vision of what they wanted their company and future to look like. This vision not only helps you build a life you want by design, it also entices great executives, employees, and partners to join you on your path to that clear and decisive \u201cVivid Vision\u201d.In This Episode We Cover:How Brandon found out about the \u201cVivid Vision\u201d and how it has changed his worldview since creating oneWhy Cameron decided to\u00a0coach COOs as opposed to CEOsThe importance of having a\u00a0COO or 2nd in command that you trust and believe inWhy your\u00a0job postings should scare\u00a0those who aren\u2019t ready to take risks and growWhy entrepreneurs have such a\u00a0hard time when letting goHow to\u00a0create your \u201cVivid Vision\u201d\u00a0in 7 stepsWhat a great \u201cVivid Vision\u201d looks like, what it includes, and how to structure itAnd\u00a0So\u00a0Much More!Links from the ShowBiggerPockets PodcastBiggerPockets book storeBrandon's InstagramDavid's InstagramBiggerPockets Business Podcast 39: Creating Your Vision and Achieving Massive Success with Cameron HeroldBiggerPockets Podcast 230: Real Estate Investing as a Side Hustle with Grammy-Winning Producer Seth MosleyBrandon's Vivid Vision\u00a0(photo)Second-In-Command PodcastVivid Vision WebsiteClick here to check the full show notes: https://www.biggerpockets.com/show447       ", "duration_ms": 5113051, "genres": ["Business & Technology"], "publisher": "BiggerPockets", "release_date": "2021-02-28", "show_rank": "9"}, {"id": "05EV9L3pYcwfBhJ1Uo3jb9", "show_id": "23JyccHPmQ8fzmpmnvQ6hR", "name": "446: Pivoting the Goal and Swapping Doors for Cashflow with Kyle and Lauren Clugston", "description": "         Have you ever had analysis paralysis?

They should know, it took them over 3 years before they made their first move in real estate investing!\u00a0In college Lauren stumbled upon Brandon\u2019s old blog about real estate investing. As she read, she gained more confidence in the craft, and knew that real estate was what she wanted to do with her money. She then started trying to convince her partner, Kyle, that real estate investing was the way to go. As someone without an investing background, Kyle was hesitant, but took a leap of faith which paid off!Now they're BRRRR-ing their way through New Jersey, with single family and multifamily properties throughout the state. Lauren and Kyle had to learn a lot before they became the real estate success stories they are now. Things like doing inspections, estimating rehab costs, getting financing, setting up systems and procedures, and getting legal documents prepared were at one point a great challenge to Lauren and Kyle. Now, they\u2019ve got them down!Lauren and Kyle lay out everything they wish their former selves had known, and go through the things that early real estate investors should worry about, and the things they definitely shouldn\u2019t lose sleep over.

We\u2019ve had writers, speakers, businesspeople, and actors, but this may be the\u00a0first rapper we\u2019ve had\u00a0with us.\u00a0Chris Greenwood AKA Manafest\u00a0is in the studio, and instead of recording beats, he\u2019s recording the best lessons he\u2019s learned through his\u00a0music career, real estate investing, and online business.Chris started out like many of us, working a stable job for a large corporation. After years of doing music on the side while working\u00a0his full time job, he decided to\u00a0take the jump and make rapping and rocking his career. Chris is the first to admit that this may not have been the best\u00a0financial decision, and staying on the job for a little while longer could have relieved him of a lot of headaches. That being said, Chris didn\u2019t just survive, he actually thrived in the music scene.When Chris and his wife decided to move out of their condo to upgrade to a larger home, they brought up the idea of\u00a0renting out the condo instead of selling. This opened Chris up to the world of\u00a0real estate investing, and as he saw the checks start to come in, he realized that this was a money maker that could help bring in\u00a0stable income, passively\u00a0while he worked on his music.Now Chris owns various properties and mainly buys from\u00a0turnkey companies. Brandon, David, and Chris all have their own opinions on\u00a0turnkey real estate investing, but they all agree on one thing: for those that don\u2019t have much time to be an active investor, it\u2019s a great way to start or stack up rental properties.Aside from rentals and rapping, Chris developed his own\u00a0online course\u00a0to teach other musicians how to successfully market their music in an industry that has such a high barrier to entry.

So how did a kid with a \u201cbroken brain\u201d become the\u00a0leading mental coach for athletes, CEOs, and movie stars?

Soon enough, Jim was reading faster, memorizing with higher accuracy, and doing well in school.His friends asked him for some tips so they could improve their grades as well. With some success in his inner circle, he decided to make a flyer for\u00a0speed reading and memory improvement classes. He put up the flyer at his college hoping one or two people would show up to his impromptu class. Over 100 students showed up, of which\u00a071 signed up for a full course with Jim. After that, Jim knew it was his\u00a0life mission to help those who wanted to learn, memorize, and live better.So\u00a0why is it so hard for some people to memorize things?

Melinda would tell anyone who would listen that she was going to kill Shanda someday, but for some reason no one took her seriously. One night Melinda gathered a group of friends including: Lauri Tacket, Hope Rippey and Toni Lawrence. The mission was to trick Shanda into thinking Amanda wanted to see her, but Amanda was not there. Three of the four girls then brutally tortured and murdered 12 year old Shanda Sharer, while one did nothing to stop them.

Melinda would tell anyone who would listen that she was going to kill Shanda someday, but for some reason no one took her seriously. One night Melinda gathered a group of friends including: Lauri Tacket, Hope Rippey and Toni Lawrence. The mission was to trick Shanda into thinking Amanda wanted to see her, but Amanda was not there. Three of the four girls then brutally tortured and murdered 12 year old Shanda Sharer, while one did nothing to stop them.

It\u2019s a memoir about being two kids in love, and then suddenly having a touring live show based on a weird fiction podcast and traveling around the world together.  You can pre-order it now! Just go to tinyurl.com/firsttenyears or wherever you get your books.  Here\u2019s the official synopsis if you want more info:   A sometimes hilarious, occasionally heartbreaking, and always entertaining joint memoir by Joseph Fink, cocreator of\u00a0Welcome to Night Vale, and his wife, writer and performer Meg Bashwiner, chronicling the first ten years of their relationship from both sides.  In 2009, 22-year-old Joseph Fink, newly arrived to New York City from the West Coast, was juggling odd jobs to pay the rent and volunteering with a theater company in the East Village so he could snag free tickets to their shows.  Meg Bashwiner, a 22-year-old aspiring performer and playwright, was living with her parents in New Jersey, working a desk job and commuting to her internship with that same East Village theater company.  Joseph and Meg's stories meet when they both find themselves selling tickets in a cramped box office. They quickly became friends. Within a year, they were a couple. Within five years they were touring the world, performing on some of the world's greatest and not so great stages.  In this candid, soul-baring memoir, Joseph and Meg recount their first ten years together, each telling their story as they remember it, without having consulted the other. We hear both sides of their first kiss, first breakup, first getting back together, the death of a father, marriage, international fame, world tours, mental illness, and discussions about having children. Sometimes, they recall things differently\u2014neither agrees on who paid for the morning after pill on their first date. Sometimes they remember the exact same details in the same way\u2014but still have their own narrative on just what those details mean.  Poignant, funny, and real, alternately told in Joseph and Meg\u2019s remarkably different, yet equally compelling voices,\u00a0The First Ten Years\u00a0is the story of two individuals finding their way in the world and becoming \"adults\" as they learn to become a couple.

I explain the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). I describe how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. I also explain how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels. As always, I describe many tools: specific supplements, prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce sugar cravings by triggering release of the hormone CCK, and more. Note: A future episode will cover Thyroid hormone. Also, I mis-spoke when explaining POMC neurons. I said \u201cP-M-O-C\u201d but should have said \u201cPOMC\u201d. Apologies. The name I gave for what POMC is, however, was correct: \"proopiomelanocortin\".

I also discuss how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex, or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. I ask: \"what specifically is it about such activities that impacts testosterone and estrogen?\"; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. I also discuss peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic level) how light, cold and heat, and respiration (breathing) can positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen. And we discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels: by changing their binding to other proteins, by raising them directly, or by changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary. I discuss optimization in the normal reference ranges for these hormones, and I discuss pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause and andropause. As always a mix of basic science, biological mechanisms and tools and protocols are discussed. **Note: Future episodes will focus on the science of prescription hormone replacement therapies, the science of hormone-based birth control and the role of testosterone, estrogen and other compounds in fertility, athletic performance and recovery. \u00a0 Thank you to our sponsors:  Four Sigmatic - http://foursigmatic.com/huberman Blinkist - http://blinkist.com/huberman Theragun - http://theragun.com/huberman  \u00a0 Bloodwork sponsor:  InsideTracker - http://insidetracker.com/huberman  \u00a0 Our Patreon page:  https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman  \u00a0 Supplements from Thorne:  http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman  \u00a0 Social:  Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab Twitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab  \u00a0 References:  http://examine.com \u201cBehavioral Endocrinology\u201d by Nelson and Kriegsfeld 5th Ed.

I describe the predictable relationship between genes, beard growth and balding patterns, and the importance of estrogen for brain development in people of all chromosomal sexes. Finally, I discuss how the hormones we are exposed to in the womb shape the relative length of our finger digits, the sounds our ears make (yes you read that correctly), and how those correlate with people's self-reports of their sexual preferences. As always, basic information and tools are discussed. \u00a0 Thank you to our sponsors:  InsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman Helix Sleep - https://helixsleep.com/huberman Athletic Greens - https://athleticgreens.com/huberman  \u00a0 Our Patreon page:  https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman  \u00a0 Supplements from Thorne:  http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman  \u00a0 Social:  Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab Twitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab  \u00a0 Links:  Mood Meter: https://moodmeterapp.com/ NSDR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL02HRFk2vo Cell Phones & Hormones: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22138021/ Finger Length Ratios & Hormones/Sexual Orientation:  https://www.nature.com/articles/35006555 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2940503/   LeVay Study in Science Magazine on Sexual Orientation Brain Dimorphism: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/253/5023/1034  \u00a0 Timestamps below.  00:00:00 Introduction 00:06:47 Announcement: Mood Meter App Works Again 00:08:00 Maximizing Learning from the Podcast 00:10:00 New Non-Sleep Deep Rest Protocol, Spanish Subtitles 00:11:35 Sexual Differentiation: Hormones, Neurons & Behavior 00:14:15 Hormones Basics 00:15:26 Sperm Meets Egg, Chromosomal Sex, Gonadal Sex, 00:17:50 Y Chromosome Inhibition of Feminization 00:19:00 Placenta Is An Endocrine (Hormone-Producing) Organ, Adrenal Testosterone 00:19:45 Hormonal Sex, Morphological Sex 00:21:04 Hormones Fast & Slow, Sex Steroids Can Turn On Genes 00:23:06 Masculinization, Feminization, Demasculinization, Defeminization 00:23:42 Primary Sexual Characteristics: DHT Drives Penis Development 00:27:03 Secondary Sexual Characteristics 00:27:43 Penis Sprouting: Guevedoces 00:31:25 Estrogen, NOT Testosterone, Masculinizes The Brain 00:33:15 Breast Development In Males: Aromatase; Puberty, & Steroids in Athletes 00:34:50 Estrogen Powerfully Controls Brain Development In All Individuals 00:35:19 Avoiding Hormonal Disruption In Children & Adults: Specific Oils, Creams, Etc. 00:39:00 Environmental Endocrine Disruptors, Sperm Count Decline, Vincloziline 00:44:20 Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome: Hormones Need Receptors, SARMS 00:48:41 Estrogen Establishes \u201cMasculine\u201d Brain Circuits, Testosterone 00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: In Babies, Puberty & Adults 00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects On Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles 01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around the World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase 01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss 01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates By Pubertal Rates 01:10:04 Hyenas, Baseball, & Jumbo Clitorises: Androstenedione 01:14:26 Intersex Moles 01:15:40 Marijuana Plants, Pollens: Plant-To-Animal \u201cWarfare\u201d 01:20:08 Finger Length Ratios, Prenatal Hormone Exposure & Sexual Orientation 01:29:13 Brain Dimorphisms with Sexual Orientation 01:32:00 \u201cOlder Brother Effects\u201d: Male Fetuses Might Change Mothers & Subsequent Brothers 01:35:06 The Path Forward & A Warning 01:35:55 Support & Your Questions  \u00a0 Please note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I focus on the science of how early infant-caregiver attachment, combined with adolescence and puberty shape our adult patterns of attachment. I explain the three universal aspects of emotions, the reality of right-brain versus left-brain personalities, and how the roots of adult attachment are also grounded in specific aspects of puberty. I review what factors determine when puberty starts and ends, and the role of oxytocin and other chemicals in controlling how we perceive and remember others. As always, I refer to various practical tools including new tools for understanding and predicting our emotions before they occur, and neurochemicals that shape human connection. \u00a0 Thank you to our sponsors:  InsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman ExpressVPN - http://expressvpn.com/huberman Magic Spoon - http://magicspoon.com/huberman  Our Patreon page:  https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman  Supplements from Thorne:  http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman  Links:  NSDR - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL02HRFk2vo Mood Meter App - https://moodmeterapp.com/ Adolescence and The Brain - https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25770 Vagus and Depression - https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/lighting-the-brain  \u00a0 Timestamps below.  00:00:00 Introduction 00:05:10 Announcing New Cost-Free Resources: Captions, NSDR Link 00:07:40 Emotions: Subjective Yet Tractable 00:10:53 To Understand Your Emotions: Look At Infancy & Puberty 00:15:21 Your First Feeling Was Anxiety 00:17:36 What Are \u201cHealthy Emotions\u201d? 00:19:03 Digital Tool For Predicting Your Emotions: Mood Meter App 00:21:08 The Architecture Of A Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions To Ask Yourself 00:24:00 You Are An Infant: Bonds & Predictions 00:27:57 Attachment Style Hinges On How You Handle Disappointment 00:32:40 \u201cGlue Points\u201d Of Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written) 00:36:34 \u201cEmotional Health\u201d: Awareness of the Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic 00:37:50 An Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias 00:42:19 Getting Out Of Your Head: The Attentional Aperture 00:46:59 Puberty: Biology & Emotions On Deliberate Overdrive 00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: The Leptin Connection 00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage 00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Of Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent 00:58:26 Neuroplasticity Of Emotions: Becoming Specialists & Testing Emotional Bonds 01:00:25 Testing Driving Brain Circuits For Emotion: Dispersal 01:07:48 Science-Based Recommendations for Adolescents and Teens: The Autonomy Buffet 01:11:05 \u201cRight-Brain Versus Left-Brain People\u201d: Facts Versus Lies 01:14:18 Left Brain = Language, Right Brain = Spatial Awareness 01:16:15 How To Recognize \u201cRight Brain Activity\u201d In Speech: Prosody 01:18:32 Oxytocin: The Molecule of Synchronizing States 01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Are Not For \u201cEmpathy\u201d, Maybe For Predicting Behavior 01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy 01:27:00 Ways To Increase Oxytocin 01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy and Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities 01:30:43 Bonding Bodies, Not Just Minds: Vagus Nerve, Depression Relief Via the Body 01:35:18 A Powerful Tool For Enhancing Range & Depth of Emotional Experience 01:30:43 MDMA and Other Psychedelic Compounds: Building A Framework 01:38:54 Roundup, Various Forms of Support  \u00a0 Please note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

Starting as a rapper in 1985, Smith is best known for his acting roles in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, I Am Legend, the Bad Boys and Men in Black film series, Aladdin and Hitch. His vast filmography also includes transformative portrayals of true-life icons in Ali, The Pursuit of Happyness and Concussion.  Today, Will Smith sits down with Jay Shetty to talk about his commitment to family, straying away from his father\u2019s military mindset in search of true happiness, and how to live the golden rule - to treat others how you want to be treated.  Jay Shetty\u2019s Conversation With Will Smith: Today, Jay Shetty welcomes his dear friend, Will Smith as they reminisce about the happy times and adventures they spent together, and how their friendship flourished as Will studies the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Jay asks Will: \u201cTell us a bit about what you learned from your parents and how you were able to process it positively? It\u2019s not easy to process negative emotions with positive thoughts.\u00a0 Jay is curious about how Will continues to achieve success with a loving heart. It\u2019s never easy to live with a military mindset yet even with success and fame it didn\u2019t feel like true happiness. Jay asks listeners to put their minds in the middle path while Will suggests learning from an athlete\u2019s mindset and level of discipline to manifest the things that they want in their life.\u00a0 Jay mentions how Will\u2019s grandmother had a huge impact in his life. It's all about finding peace by living your life in service. His parents, on the other hand, had different principles and pushed for totally different things, yet they showed him how life should be lived.\u00a0 Jay talks about the hard work Will had to do that people don\u2019t really see. A lot of people have not seen the learning accumulated through hard work, the sacrifices made along the way, and the military mindset that Will cradled so deeply within. Jay points out that most superheroes get their powers when bad things happen to them. This is also true for everyone, that most of our experiences happen to teach us a lesson. Will then added that there is no such thing as a bad experience. Jay taps into Will\u2019s last moments with his father and how he coped with the loss. The lesson learned from the experience is to always be genuine with your every \u201cHello\u201d and \u201cGoodbye\u201d, who knows it could be the last. Jay asks Will about how the tradition to learn new religion every year, how this strengthened his bond with Jada, and the lessons learned while studying these different religions. Jay talks to Will about the wisdom within books, how past people had lived through the same problems that most of us are dealing with today. Treating people the way you want to be treated is essential in maintaining peaceful relationships around you. Jay explains the Analogy of the Mirror wherein people become so disconnected from nature that everything becomes instant and our mindset has become NOW whereas nature is never instant.\u00a0 Jay shares the first time he communicated with Will. It surprised him how Will can be so committed to the things he sets his mind on. And that prompted Jay to relearn and fall back in love with the things he fell in love years ago. Commitment is changing yourself through constant practice. Will explains why the central focus of his life is having a successful love relationship. This determination came after his experience with his parents divorce. He continues to seek knowledge on achieving this goal.\u00a0 Will discusses why the concepts of ignorance and delusion are always the center of problems in every human relationship. All issues within human relations stem from a lack of understanding. Will retells his unforgettable encounter with Nelson Mandela and how he was offered to be his student about life struggles.\u00a0 Jay is curious why Will is so moved by the Story of Arjun. Will eagerly explains the story and why it resonated with so much.\u00a0\u00a0 Jay explains that most of us are living our life based on the result of our actions, which we think is a sign of success. We shouldn\u2019t be living a life based on the possible results of our actions, instead we should live for ourselves and our own happiness. Jay and Will agree on this: It's not a problem if you have comprehension of what's happening around you. You don't call things problems that you have complete comprehension of. Will relives his character as The Genie, a character so similar to his personality, his core. The concept of the sacred clown, the singing, dancing, and joy it brings, is beautiful conduit for the ideas.\u00a0 Will Smith ON the Fast Five questions  Like this show?

Soothe your newborn, watch them quickly fall asleep and get some well deserved relaxation yourself. Baby white noise is an effective way to soothe a crying baby and lull your newborn to sleep. White noise resembles sounds the baby heard in the womb, which has a calming effect. It also masks other distracting noises so that your baby can fall asleep and remain sleeping.  Millions of parents have used our baby sleep sounds with their fussy newborns. White noise is recommended by pediatricians including Dr. Harvey Karp, author of The Happiest Baby On The Block.  While playing white noise for babies, it\u2019s important to keep tabs on the volume, because any white noise machine, smartphone, or computer can put out levels that are too loud for your child. It's recommended to play the sound at least a few feet from where your infant is sleeping and to keep the volume no louder than the sound of a soft shower. Parents can download an app to turn their smartphone into a sound level meter. One good, free, option is the sound level meter app created by the U.S. National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) available on the app store as the NIOSH SLM app. Soothe your crying baby and enjoy a moment of calm!

Dogs often start barking when they hear strange sounds, sometimes while you are away or sometimes in the middle of the night. Noises coming from neighbors, other dogs, car alarms, fireworks, gardeners, sirens, doors slamming and so forth can set a dog into a barking frenzy. A great way to prevent this from happening is to play white noise, which is safe and effective.  White noise drowns out extraneous sounds, and creates a soothing environment for your pet. By limiting exposure to sounds that set your dog off in the first place, you reduce the occurrences of fright barking. You and your best friend will both be more relaxed with this white noise for dogs.

The binaural beats can help induce delta waves in the brain, which is the brainwave associated with sleeping. This sound can help you achieve a night of great, restful sleep. Binaural beats work best when listened to with headphones.  Delta waves are a band of brainwaves that measure in cycles between .5Hz-4Hz on an EEG. These are frequencies well below human hearing (20Hz), so we need to \"trick\" the brain into being able to perceive cycles that low. Binaural Beats attempts to promote the creation of these brainwave frequencies by playing two different audible tones with a difference of the desired frequency, one in each ear of headphones. For instance, in this case, 53Hz and 55Hz, which has a difference of 2Hz, a Delta band frequency associated with deep sleep. This 2Hz difference intertwines inside the listener's brain which scientists believe causes it to synchronize with this 2Hz frequency. Neuro-Feedback theory suggests that the brain will recognize this 2Hz frequency as being associated with deep sleep, and will in tern, induce this state.  For this sound, we additionally added brownian noise to smooth over the dry tones. But we've filtered them in such a way that they, too, contained a 2Hz frequency difference in each ear. So the brain should be perceiving a 2Hz phasing difference, from all sounds involved.  Sleep well!

Tony brings guest Michael to the show, who shares with us all about a life riddled with unusual experiences pointing to him possibly be an alien abductee at the age of three. Michael was visited by entities at that time, and later came to understand that they were Grey extraterrestrials. He lays out a series of events which followed as he grew older that sometimes left him feeling so terrified he was afraid to go to sleep at night. The feeling of ice cold hands grabbing him eventually became a tell that alerted him he was being attacked. Once while he was sleeping he found himself in a type of sleep paralysis state from which he could not awaken, and all the while he felt like something was peeling the skin off of his feet. When he finally came out of it, hediscovered he really was missing chunks of skin! Michael also describes another instance when he felt the ice cold hands grabbing his ankles and pulling him off his bed, only to drag him down the hall. What happened as he was being dragged is hard for himto describe or understand because it seemed like he was being taken into a whole other realm. Michael shares as many bits and pieces of these abduction events as he can remember on this week\u2019s swapcast episode, \u2018They Took My Flesh. \u00a0 If you want o hear me on The Confessionals, come listen to at  https://www.theconfessionalspodcast.com/theconfessionals/307-billy-the-kid-the-man-who-died-twice \u00a0", "duration_ms": 4308724, "genres": ["Science"], "publisher": "Sasquatch Chronicles - Bigfoot Encounters", "release_date": "2021-01-25", "show_rank": "10"}, {"id": "1tlS3ll5hR5X7llUNbMAlp", "show_id": "4jriVXIcI6g4ZUVGsS1JqB", "name": "SC EP:724 The Sounds They Make", "description": "Patrick writes \"It was October 13th 2016.

She started her acting career as a child, and put out her first albums as a teenager. She\u2019s had three number one albums and eight Top 10 hits, and in 2017, Billboard named her Woman of the Year. At one point, she was the most followed person on Instagram, and the details of her life are constantly discussed in tabloid headlines.  So, when your private life is that public, how do you write a song about something as personal as heartbreak? Selena teamed up with the Grammy-winning production duo Mattman & Robin, who she\u2019d worked with before. And she turned to her longtime songwriting collaborators, Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter. Julia Michaels is also a Grammy-nominated artist in her own right, and Justin Tranter, also a Grammy nominee, was named BMI\u2019s 2017 Pop Songwriter of the Year. The three of them have written 10 songs together, including this one, \u201cLose You to Love Me.\u201d The song came out in October 2019, and went on to become Selena\u2019s first number-one hit. It went double-platinum in the US, and was named one of the best songs of the year by Vulture and Billboard. In this episode, Selena, Julia and Justin break down how the song came to be, from the first writing session to the final production touches from Finneas.  songexploder.net/selena-gomez       ", "duration_ms": 1307051, "genres": ["Music"], "publisher": "Hrishikesh Hirway", "release_date": "2020-09-23", "show_rank": "2"}, {"id": "3gobz3LV8CyO108iBsISyL", "show_id": "10lMwCjvzLCLwth2AW6cLG", "name": "Reissue: Ludwig G\u00f6ransson - Black Panther", "description": "         On August 28, 2020, actor Chadwick Boseman died. He was only 43 years old. Unbeknownst to many, even some of his closest collaborators, he\u2019d been battling colon cancer since 2016. His family released a statement, and in it, they said, \"It was the honor of his career to bring King T\u2019Challa to life in Black Panther.\" After hearing the news, I went back and re-watched the movie, and I don\u2019t know, it was a completely different experience this time. I went and listened to the score again, and that had changed for me, too. So, I wanted to back and share this episode from 2018, about a piece of the film\u2019s score by composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson. It\u2019s one of my favorites, and since it first aired, Ludwig went on to win the Grammy and Oscar for the Black Panther score.  I hope you enjoy this re-visiting this episode, and I hope it makes you remember how great Black Panther is, and how great Chadwick Boseman is in it, in a role that defined a career that was way too short.  \u00b7\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0 Marvel\u2019s Black Panther was released in theaters on February 16, 2018, and in just a few weeks, it made over a billion dollars worldwide. It\u2019s already broken some box office records and it looks like it\u2019s going to break some more. The score for the film was created by Swedish composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson. His film and tv credits include Creed and New Girl. He\u2019s also Grammy-nominated producer, who\u2019s worked most often with rapper Childish Gambino. In this episode, Ludwig takes apart one of his pieces from Black Panther. The track is called \"Killmonger,\" and it\u2019s the theme for Erik Killmonger, a character played by Michael B. Jordan. Black Panther is set in the fictional African nation of Wakanda, and coming up, Ludwig tells the story of doing research and making recordings in Africa, and how he incorporated that into the score for the film.

Ft. Shannon Gomez of Rebel Deck", "description": "Shannon Gomez is an intuitive and the creator of REBEL Deck LLC, holds a Master of Science in Oriental Medicine and is a Licensed Acupuncturist and Herbalist. While she hold many passions in the health and wellness community, Rebel Deck came to her during a time where she felt she was sinking in a deep emotional hole and thus gave her the inspiration to birth these sassy, funny and in-your-face oracle decks. Shannon is also the founder of Indie Deck Hub. She was inspired to create this innovative sales channel as a way to support and empower fellow deck creators. She had been looking for intuitive guidance that felt down-to-earth, like a bestie that was lovingly holding her face but simultaneously telling her to quit fucking whining and get up! Not finding really any cards that had this vibe, she went on to not only create them but they have become a bestselling deck that has been seen in Allure, E! Entertainment, The Yoga Journal, Elephant Journal and Phoenix Magazine. Her mission with REBEL Deck is to create spiritual and self-improvement tools that are real + relatable and out of the spiritual box. She says \u201c Fuck that Noise\u201d to conformists and wants to give people a space to be themselves fully on their spiritual journey. Today we talk about card reading but also so much about taking spirituality out the box and finding new ways to connect that are the fullest expressions of our personal selves.

Satterfield has worked as DNA scientist for many years with the hope of inventing technologies that would benefit the world. This is how he understood his mission here on earth, and he has been exceedingly successful at it. Recently, his DNA testing technologies have impacted millions of people in more than fifty countries, including but not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic. But while he had an exceedingly logical mind, Dr. Brent was a man of faith. Following multiple experiences with heaven, he became a student of consciousness, faith, and experiences of God in cultures around the world. He has achieved mastery level in Matrix Energetics, Theta Healing, Reiki, and other healing modalities in addition to studying the techniques of Native Americans, Hindu miracle workers, and Christian street healers. In his book, Bringing Heaven Home, Satterfield, Ph.D., recounts his journey of shifting his conservative Christian beliefs through many NDE-like, out of body experiences. His search for truth resulted in his involvement in reassessing conservative Christianity. However, he found that as he had more and more supernatural experiences, even the leaders of various churches could not relate with him.    In December 2020, Brent became a cofounder of the Inner World Movement. He is excited to begin developing online courses and gathering a community to promote this message, as well as Dr. Brent is the author of two books, Faith to Produce Miracles and Bringing Heaven Home that express his true desire in connecting with like-minded individuals, sharing spiritual experiences and walking with individuals that are determined to find what is the most authentic path for themselves.

Daniel G", "description": "As a child, Daniel had always believed there was more to the world than what met the eye, but the education system taught him that this wasn\u2019t the case. Science held the answers to everything, and if science couldn\u2019t answer a mystery, then there was no merit to it. So every feeling he had which strayed from mainstream thinking, became tucked away in the back of my head.\u00a0\u00a0And like so many others in our world, he became one of the herd. Fast-forward a decade: nothing felt right; there was no fulfillment in my life, then BAM! He was struck down with an autoimmune disorder - which greatly diminished his ability to function in the world.\u00a0\u00a0As a firm believer in science, he spent the next 6 years visiting new doctors, clinging on to the belief that only\u00a0they\u00a0could fix him. One day I took a good hard look in the mirror and said to himself,\u201d\u00a0we\u2019ve got to find another way.\u201d A couple in a class he has taken asked him if he\u2019d every tried a past life regression and it sparked his interest enough that 6 months later, he gave it a try. While his first past life regression experience didn\u2019t completely heal his autoimmune disorder, he left with a new perspective on life:\u00a0after the experience he had just had, he was made a firm believer in past lives. \u201cThat means there\u00a0will\u00a0be a next life. It could be better, or it could be worse\u2026 these are the cards I\u2019ve been dealt this time around, so how am I going to play them the best way I can?\u201d A year later, in 2016, he became a certified past life practitioner of QHHT\u00ae from Dolores Cannon\u2019s Quantum Healing Hypnosis Academy. Aside from his practice, he\u2019s continued to engage in his own regressions with other practitioners of different methods (just to see all the field has to offer.

Victoria Albina ", "description": "Victoria Albina, NP, MPH is a Certified Life Coach, Breathwork Meditation Facilitator, Holistic Nurse Practitioner, and host of the podcast \u2018Feminist Wellness.\u2019 She is on a mission to help women raised by codependents and alcoholics to stop feeling anxious, stuck and overwhelmed so they can have better relationships with their partners, parents and themselves. She teaches women how to live with confidence and radical, unapologetic self-love, worldwide via the magic of the internet. Victoria started her wellness journey after a lifetime of being sick and navigating the complexities of living with and being raised by a family impacted by trauma and codependency. After 30 years of digestive issues, depression and anxiety, she healed herself through cutting edge Functional Medicine, herbal medicine and finally through nervous system healing and life coaching. While her health improved by healing her leaky gut, the true and lasting healing came by learning to manage her mind to let go of the self-doubt, approval-seeking and negative self-talk that were keeping her nervous system revved up, and her body paying the price. With 20 years in health & wellness, her work is the place where the science and the sacred meet - equal parts total nerd, modern-day witch, and asker-of-smart-questions. Victoria brings cognitive psychology, somatic healing, neuroscience and feminist theory to her work, providing both a unique framework for understanding the effects of the patriarchy and capitalism one\u2019s mental and physical health, and an effective yet simple protocol for rewriting harmful old thought patterns to release anxiety and insecurity and to feel confident instead. She now lives a life she loves, and her decades of illness are fuel for her desire to help women drop the rock of codependent thinking, stress and overwhelm, to live the lives of their dreams.

Mastering Your Mind & Manifestations To Stop Fucking Yourself Over ft. Roxy talks", "description": "Roxy always knew she was here to share a message. She\u00a0followed the path of a music career while earning her Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Behavioral Science. As she navigated her life searching for fame in the music industry, she stumbled on the Law of Attraction in 2011 and began her journey of understanding her place in the Universe. After nearly a decade of searching and perfecting her craft and mission, she built her own process that she then used to change her life. Up until that point, she was barely making it by financially. Her husband and her lived off of his income alone, struggling to make ends meet in a one bedroom apartment in Los Angeles. During that time, she felt compelled to put her music career on pause and was steered towards speaking and coaching. Via Youtube, her message to the people was finally becoming clear, and she knew what she was here to say in clarity about manifesting and the forces at hand in this world. She has trained herself under a disciplined regimen of mental focus, and What she soon learned was that the more disciplined she became with her thoughts, the easier, better, quicker her manifestations unfolded. It was here that she began developing her 360 Method which became the corner stone of her business. Today her goal is to help millions of people understand their own personal power and tap into it in the most natural and productive way. Each person is different, each situation is unique, and so she offers a custom tailored approach that creates the best environment for success, whether that\u2019s through one-on-one coaching, courses, workshops videos, a thriving youtube channel and more. Roxy talks with conviction and a raw directness that kicks you out of your comfort zone and begs you to take accountability and action towards the co-creation process of your life.

When Walmart adds $1 billion of bitcoin to its balance sheet, you'll have that same average Joe\u2019s full attention. It will create the ultimate exposure for Bitcoin to blue collar Americans and trigger a global monetary paradigm shift that is long overdue.

RECORD BTC WEEKLY CLOSE!!", "description": " Macro guru investor Raoul Pal is suggesting that a seven-figure price tag on Bitcoin this bull run is not as unrealistic as crypto investors might think. In a new interview with Dr. Julian Hosp, the former Goldman Sachs executive says that from his perspective, the current BTC bull cycle looks a lot like the 2013 cycle, but is ahead of the 2017 cycle in terms of gains.  Based on the two previous cycles, Pal says that the \u201coverbought\u201d region where Bitcoin could hit a wall and correct is roughly at the $400,000 level. However, he also says if this level gets broken like it did the last two cycles, a $1,000,000 BTC would then be in the cards.  \u201cFor it to get to kind of one standard deviation overbought it\u2019s about $400,000. But if it gets to two standard deviations where it got to the last two times, it\u2019s $1,000,000.\u201d  For complete show notes and for the full premium experience with video, visit our YouTube channel at http://CryptoNewsAlerts.net", "duration_ms": 1309414, "genres": ["Technology"], "publisher": "Justin Verrengia", "release_date": "2021-04-12", "show_rank": "2"}, {"id": "071cAxVp1qQGLeQL9J6XAk", "show_id": "2jXIy9OQZh2gI65OwfvaPq", "name": "538: THIS IS BITCOIN ROCKET FUEL!!
