In 2009, 22-year-old Joseph Fink, newly arrived to New York City from the West Coast, was juggling odd jobs to pay the rent and volunteering with a theater company in the East Village so he could snag free tickets to their shows.  Meg Bashwiner, a 22-year-old aspiring performer and playwright, was living with her parents in New Jersey, working a desk job and commuting to her internship with that same East Village theater company.  Joseph and Meg's stories meet when they both find themselves selling tickets in a cramped box office. They quickly became friends. Within a year, they were a couple. Within five years they were touring the world, performing on some of the world's greatest and not so great stages.  In this candid, soul-baring memoir, Joseph and Meg recount their first ten years together, each telling their story as they remember it, without having consulted the other. We hear both sides of their first kiss, first breakup, first getting back together, the death of a father, marriage, international fame, world tours, mental illness, and discussions about having children. Sometimes, they recall things differently\u2014neither agrees on who paid for the morning after pill on their first date. Sometimes they remember the exact same details in the same way\u2014but still have their own narrative on just what those details mean.  Poignant, funny, and real, alternately told in Joseph and Meg\u2019s remarkably different, yet equally compelling voices,\u00a0The First Ten Years\u00a0is the story of two individuals finding their way in the world and becoming \"adults\" as they learn to become a couple.

I explain the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). I describe how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. I also explain how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels. As always, I describe many tools: specific supplements, prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce sugar cravings by triggering release of the hormone CCK, and more. Note: A future episode will cover Thyroid hormone. Also, I mis-spoke when explaining POMC neurons. I said \u201cP-M-O-C\u201d but should have said \u201cPOMC\u201d. Apologies. The name I gave for what POMC is, however, was correct: \"proopiomelanocortin\".

I also discuss how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex, or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. I ask: \"what specifically is it about such activities that impacts testosterone and estrogen?\"; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. I also discuss peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic level) how light, cold and heat, and respiration (breathing) can positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen. And we discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels: by changing their binding to other proteins, by raising them directly, or by changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary. I discuss optimization in the normal reference ranges for these hormones, and I discuss pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause and andropause. As always a mix of basic science, biological mechanisms and tools and protocols are discussed. **Note: Future episodes will focus on the science of prescription hormone replacement therapies, the science of hormone-based birth control and the role of testosterone, estrogen and other compounds in fertility, athletic performance and recovery. \u00a0 Thank you to our sponsors:  Four Sigmatic - http://foursigmatic.com/huberman Blinkist - http://blinkist.com/huberman Theragun - http://theragun.com/huberman  \u00a0 Bloodwork sponsor:  InsideTracker - http://insidetracker.com/huberman  \u00a0 Our Patreon page:  https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman  \u00a0 Supplements from Thorne:  http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman  \u00a0 Social:  Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab Twitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab  \u00a0 References:  http://examine.com \u201cBehavioral Endocrinology\u201d by Nelson and Kriegsfeld 5th Ed.

I review published data on environmental factors shown to powerfully alter hormone pathways in animals and humans and the effects of cannabis, alcohol and cell phones on testes, sperm, ovaries and hormones. I describe the predictable relationship between genes, beard growth and balding patterns, and the importance of estrogen for brain development in people of all chromosomal sexes. Finally, I discuss how the hormones we are exposed to in the womb shape the relative length of our finger digits, the sounds our ears make (yes you read that correctly), and how those correlate with people's self-reports of their sexual preferences. As always, basic information and tools are discussed. \u00a0 Thank you to our sponsors:  InsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman Helix Sleep - https://helixsleep.com/huberman Athletic Greens - https://athleticgreens.com/huberman  \u00a0 Our Patreon page:  https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman  \u00a0 Supplements from Thorne:  http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman  \u00a0 Social:  Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab Twitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab  \u00a0 Links:  Mood Meter: https://moodmeterapp.com/ NSDR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL02HRFk2vo Cell Phones & Hormones: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22138021/ Finger Length Ratios & Hormones/Sexual Orientation:  https://www.nature.com/articles/35006555 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2940503/   LeVay Study in Science Magazine on Sexual Orientation Brain Dimorphism: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/253/5023/1034  \u00a0 Timestamps below.  00:00:00 Introduction 00:06:47 Announcement: Mood Meter App Works Again 00:08:00 Maximizing Learning from the Podcast 00:10:00 New Non-Sleep Deep Rest Protocol, Spanish Subtitles 00:11:35 Sexual Differentiation: Hormones, Neurons & Behavior 00:14:15 Hormones Basics 00:15:26 Sperm Meets Egg, Chromosomal Sex, Gonadal Sex, 00:17:50 Y Chromosome Inhibition of Feminization 00:19:00 Placenta Is An Endocrine (Hormone-Producing) Organ, Adrenal Testosterone 00:19:45 Hormonal Sex, Morphological Sex 00:21:04 Hormones Fast & Slow, Sex Steroids Can Turn On Genes 00:23:06 Masculinization, Feminization, Demasculinization, Defeminization 00:23:42 Primary Sexual Characteristics: DHT Drives Penis Development 00:27:03 Secondary Sexual Characteristics 00:27:43 Penis Sprouting: Guevedoces 00:31:25 Estrogen, NOT Testosterone, Masculinizes The Brain 00:33:15 Breast Development In Males: Aromatase; Puberty, & Steroids in Athletes 00:34:50 Estrogen Powerfully Controls Brain Development In All Individuals 00:35:19 Avoiding Hormonal Disruption In Children & Adults: Specific Oils, Creams, Etc. 00:39:00 Environmental Endocrine Disruptors, Sperm Count Decline, Vincloziline 00:44:20 Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome: Hormones Need Receptors, SARMS 00:48:41 Estrogen Establishes \u201cMasculine\u201d Brain Circuits, Testosterone 00:49:42 Cannabis, Alcohol: In Babies, Puberty & Adults 00:56:25 Cell Phone Technology: Effects On Hormones, Ovaries, & Testicles 01:02:33 Beards & Baldness Patterns Around the World, DHT, 5-alpha-reductase 01:06:39 Creatine & DHT/Hair Loss 01:08:20 Predicting Aging Rates By Pubertal Rates 01:10:04 Hyenas, Baseball, & Jumbo Clitorises: Androstenedione 01:14:26 Intersex Moles 01:15:40 Marijuana Plants, Pollens: Plant-To-Animal \u201cWarfare\u201d 01:20:08 Finger Length Ratios, Prenatal Hormone Exposure & Sexual Orientation 01:29:13 Brain Dimorphisms with Sexual Orientation 01:32:00 \u201cOlder Brother Effects\u201d: Male Fetuses Might Change Mothers & Subsequent Brothers 01:35:06 The Path Forward & A Warning 01:35:55 Support & Your Questions  \u00a0 Please note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I explain the three universal aspects of emotions, the reality of right-brain versus left-brain personalities, and how the roots of adult attachment are also grounded in specific aspects of puberty. I review what factors determine when puberty starts and ends, and the role of oxytocin and other chemicals in controlling how we perceive and remember others. As always, I refer to various practical tools including new tools for understanding and predicting our emotions before they occur, and neurochemicals that shape human connection. \u00a0 Thank you to our sponsors:  InsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman ExpressVPN - http://expressvpn.com/huberman Magic Spoon - http://magicspoon.com/huberman  Our Patreon page:  https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman  Supplements from Thorne:  http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman  Links:  NSDR - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pL02HRFk2vo Mood Meter App - https://moodmeterapp.com/ Adolescence and The Brain - https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25770 Vagus and Depression - https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/lighting-the-brain  \u00a0 Timestamps below.  00:00:00 Introduction 00:05:10 Announcing New Cost-Free Resources: Captions, NSDR Link 00:07:40 Emotions: Subjective Yet Tractable 00:10:53 To Understand Your Emotions: Look At Infancy & Puberty 00:15:21 Your First Feeling Was Anxiety 00:17:36 What Are \u201cHealthy Emotions\u201d? 00:19:03 Digital Tool For Predicting Your Emotions: Mood Meter App 00:21:08 The Architecture Of A Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions To Ask Yourself 00:24:00 You Are An Infant: Bonds & Predictions 00:27:57 Attachment Style Hinges On How You Handle Disappointment 00:32:40 \u201cGlue Points\u201d Of Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (& Written) 00:36:34 \u201cEmotional Health\u201d: Awareness of the Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic 00:37:50 An Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias 00:42:19 Getting Out Of Your Head: The Attentional Aperture 00:46:59 Puberty: Biology & Emotions On Deliberate Overdrive 00:47:58 Bodyfat & Puberty: The Leptin Connection 00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage 00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Of Puberty & Performance Enhancing Agent 00:58:26 Neuroplasticity Of Emotions: Becoming Specialists & Testing Emotional Bonds 01:00:25 Testing Driving Brain Circuits For Emotion: Dispersal 01:07:48 Science-Based Recommendations for Adolescents and Teens: The Autonomy Buffet 01:11:05 \u201cRight-Brain Versus Left-Brain People\u201d: Facts Versus Lies 01:14:18 Left Brain = Language, Right Brain = Spatial Awareness 01:16:15 How To Recognize \u201cRight Brain Activity\u201d In Speech: Prosody 01:18:32 Oxytocin: The Molecule of Synchronizing States 01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Are Not For \u201cEmpathy\u201d, Maybe For Predicting Behavior 01:23:00 Promoting Trust & Monogamy 01:27:00 Ways To Increase Oxytocin 01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy and Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities 01:30:43 Bonding Bodies, Not Just Minds: Vagus Nerve, Depression Relief Via the Body 01:35:18 A Powerful Tool For Enhancing Range & Depth of Emotional Experience 01:30:43 MDMA and Other Psychedelic Compounds: Building A Framework 01:38:54 Roundup, Various Forms of Support  \u00a0 Please note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

Starting as a rapper in 1985, Smith is best known for his acting roles in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, I Am Legend, the Bad Boys and Men in Black film series, Aladdin and Hitch. His vast filmography also includes transformative portrayals of true-life icons in Ali, The Pursuit of Happyness and Concussion.  Today, Will Smith sits down with Jay Shetty to talk about his commitment to family, straying away from his father\u2019s military mindset in search of true happiness, and how to live the golden rule - to treat others how you want to be treated.  Jay Shetty\u2019s Conversation With Will Smith: Today, Jay Shetty welcomes his dear friend, Will Smith as they reminisce about the happy times and adventures they spent together, and how their friendship flourished as Will studies the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Jay asks Will: \u201cTell us a bit about what you learned from your parents and how you were able to process it positively? It\u2019s not easy to process negative emotions with positive thoughts.\u00a0 Jay is curious about how Will continues to achieve success with a loving heart. It\u2019s never easy to live with a military mindset yet even with success and fame it didn\u2019t feel like true happiness. Jay asks listeners to put their minds in the middle path while Will suggests learning from an athlete\u2019s mindset and level of discipline to manifest the things that they want in their life.\u00a0 Jay mentions how Will\u2019s grandmother had a huge impact in his life. It's all about finding peace by living your life in service. His parents, on the other hand, had different principles and pushed for totally different things, yet they showed him how life should be lived.\u00a0 Jay talks about the hard work Will had to do that people don\u2019t really see. A lot of people have not seen the learning accumulated through hard work, the sacrifices made along the way, and the military mindset that Will cradled so deeply within. Jay points out that most superheroes get their powers when bad things happen to them. This is also true for everyone, that most of our experiences happen to teach us a lesson. Will then added that there is no such thing as a bad experience. Jay taps into Will\u2019s last moments with his father and how he coped with the loss. The lesson learned from the experience is to always be genuine with your every \u201cHello\u201d and \u201cGoodbye\u201d, who knows it could be the last. Jay asks Will about how the tradition to learn new religion every year, how this strengthened his bond with Jada, and the lessons learned while studying these different religions. Jay talks to Will about the wisdom within books, how past people had lived through the same problems that most of us are dealing with today. Treating people the way you want to be treated is essential in maintaining peaceful relationships around you. Jay explains the Analogy of the Mirror wherein people become so disconnected from nature that everything becomes instant and our mindset has become NOW whereas nature is never instant.\u00a0 Jay shares the first time he communicated with Will. It surprised him how Will can be so committed to the things he sets his mind on. And that prompted Jay to relearn and fall back in love with the things he fell in love years ago. Commitment is changing yourself through constant practice. Will explains why the central focus of his life is having a successful love relationship. This determination came after his experience with his parents divorce. He continues to seek knowledge on achieving this goal.\u00a0 Will discusses why the concepts of ignorance and delusion are always the center of problems in every human relationship. All issues within human relations stem from a lack of understanding. Will retells his unforgettable encounter with Nelson Mandela and how he was offered to be his student about life struggles.\u00a0 Jay is curious why Will is so moved by the Story of Arjun. Will eagerly explains the story and why it resonated with so much.\u00a0\u00a0 Jay explains that most of us are living our life based on the result of our actions, which we think is a sign of success. We shouldn\u2019t be living a life based on the possible results of our actions, instead we should live for ourselves and our own happiness. Jay and Will agree on this: It's not a problem if you have comprehension of what's happening around you. You don't call things problems that you have complete comprehension of. Will relives his character as The Genie, a character so similar to his personality, his core. The concept of the sacred clown, the singing, dancing, and joy it brings, is beautiful conduit for the ideas.\u00a0 Will Smith ON the Fast Five questions  Like this show?

Soothe your newborn, watch them quickly fall asleep and get some well deserved relaxation yourself. Baby white noise is an effective way to soothe a crying baby and lull your newborn to sleep. White noise resembles sounds the baby heard in the womb, which has a calming effect. It also masks other distracting noises so that your baby can fall asleep and remain sleeping.  Millions of parents have used our baby sleep sounds with their fussy newborns. White noise is recommended by pediatricians including Dr. Harvey Karp, author of The Happiest Baby On The Block.  While playing white noise for babies, it\u2019s important to keep tabs on the volume, because any white noise machine, smartphone, or computer can put out levels that are too loud for your child. It's recommended to play the sound at least a few feet from where your infant is sleeping and to keep the volume no louder than the sound of a soft shower. Parents can download an app to turn their smartphone into a sound level meter. One good, free, option is the sound level meter app created by the U.S. National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) available on the app store as the NIOSH SLM app. Soothe your crying baby and enjoy a moment of calm!

Dogs often start barking when they hear strange sounds, sometimes while you are away or sometimes in the middle of the night. Noises coming from neighbors, other dogs, car alarms, fireworks, gardeners, sirens, doors slamming and so forth can set a dog into a barking frenzy. A great way to prevent this from happening is to play white noise, which is safe and effective.  White noise drowns out extraneous sounds, and creates a soothing environment for your pet. By limiting exposure to sounds that set your dog off in the first place, you reduce the occurrences of fright barking.
