But our say-almost-anything approach to free speech is actually relatively recent, and you can trace it back to one guy: a Supreme Court justice named Oliver Wendell Holmes. Even weirder, you can trace it back to one seemingly ordinary 8-month period in Holmes\u2019s life when he seems to have done a logical U-turn on what should be say-able.\u00a0 Why he changed his mind during those 8 months is one of the greatest mysteries in the history of the Supreme Court.\u00a0 (Spoiler: the answer involves anarchists, a house of truth, and a cry for help from a dear friend.)\u00a0 Join us as we investigate why he changed his mind, how that made the country change its mind, and whether it\u2019s now time to change our minds again.

He had lymphoma, and the disease plus his drugs weakened his immune system, making him particularly susceptible to the virus. He wasn\u2019t too bad off, considering, and was sent home.

The navy reported a mysterious sound deep below the surface of the ocean. Again, and again, and again they would hear it near their secret military bases, in their harbors, and up and down the Swedish coastline.\u00a0 After thorough analysis the navy was certain. The sound was an invasion into their waters, an act of war, the opening salvos of a possible nuclear annihilation.\u00a0 Or was it?\u00a0 Today, Annie McEwen pulls us down into a deep-sea mystery, one of international intrigue that asks you to consider the possibility that maybe, just maybe, your deepest beliefs could be as solid as...air.

That is, deciding what you and I are allowed to post on the site and what we\u2019re not. Missteps by Facebook in this area have fueled everything from a genocide in Myanmar to viral disinformation surrounding politics and the coronavirus. However, just this past year, conceding their failings, Facebook shifted its approach. They erected an independent body of twenty jurors that will make the final call on many of Facebook\u2019s thorniest decisions. This body has been called: Facebook\u2019s Supreme Court. So today, in collaboration with the New Yorker magazine and the New Yorker Radio Hour, we explore how this body came to be, what power it really has and how the consequences of its decisions will be nothing short of life or death. This episode was reported and produced by Simon Adler. To hear more about the court's origin,\u00a0their rulings so far, and\u00a0their upcoming docket, check out David Remnick and reporter Kate Klonick\u2019s conversation in the New Yorker Radio Hour podcast feed.

Dogs often start barking when they hear strange sounds, sometimes while you are away or sometimes in the middle of the night. Noises coming from neighbors, other dogs, car alarms, fireworks, gardeners, sirens, doors slamming and so forth can set a dog into a barking frenzy. A great way to prevent this from happening is to play white noise, which is safe and effective.  White noise drowns out extraneous sounds, and creates a soothing environment for your pet. By limiting exposure to sounds that set your dog off in the first place, you reduce the occurrences of fright barking. You and your best friend will both be more relaxed with this white noise for dogs.

We are joined by Jamie Lee, comedian, actor, author of the book Weddiculous: An Unfiltered Guide to Being a Bride, and host of The Wedding Coach on Netflix, to talk about the ups and downs of getting married. We discuss how to set yourself up for success and also manage conflict with your partner during the planning process so it doesn't tear you apart. And we're getting real about pulling the plug on a wedding even when you feel like \"the train has left the station.\" Most importantly, we discuss bachelorette parties, and hooking up at weddings (ahem, what brides and grooms can do to help their single friends out).

It\u2019s a memoir about being two kids in love, and then suddenly having a touring live show based on a weird fiction podcast and traveling around the world together.  You can pre-order it now! Just go to tinyurl.com/firsttenyears or wherever you get your books.  Here\u2019s the official synopsis if you want more info:   A sometimes hilarious, occasionally heartbreaking, and always entertaining joint memoir by Joseph Fink, cocreator of\u00a0Welcome to Night Vale, and his wife, writer and performer Meg Bashwiner, chronicling the first ten years of their relationship from both sides.  In 2009, 22-year-old Joseph Fink, newly arrived to New York City from the West Coast, was juggling odd jobs to pay the rent and volunteering with a theater company in the East Village so he could snag free tickets to their shows.  Meg Bashwiner, a 22-year-old aspiring performer and playwright, was living with her parents in New Jersey, working a desk job and commuting to her internship with that same East Village theater company.  Joseph and Meg's stories meet when they both find themselves selling tickets in a cramped box office. They quickly became friends. Within a year, they were a couple. Within five years they were touring the world, performing on some of the world's greatest and not so great stages.  In this candid, soul-baring memoir, Joseph and Meg recount their first ten years together, each telling their story as they remember it, without having consulted the other. We hear both sides of their first kiss, first breakup, first getting back together, the death of a father, marriage, international fame, world tours, mental illness, and discussions about having children. Sometimes, they recall things differently\u2014neither agrees on who paid for the morning after pill on their first date. Sometimes they remember the exact same details in the same way\u2014but still have their own narrative on just what those details mean.  Poignant, funny, and real, alternately told in Joseph and Meg\u2019s remarkably different, yet equally compelling voices,\u00a0The First Ten Years\u00a0is the story of two individuals finding their way in the world and becoming \"adults\" as they learn to become a couple.

He soon caught the motion again out of the corner of his eye, and then, following it, he watched one of the pepper shakers from the top of the stove start to levitate before rapidly floating over and landing beside him. \"  \u00a0  Known as the Project Poltergeist, Dan's first tale is the first documented case of poltergeist activity taking place in one of American\u2019s government housing projects. It\u2019s been called the Project Poltergeist. The strange tale of a lot of paranormal activity following a young man, Ernie Rivers. Who is the poltergeist? Is it Ernie's Dad? Did he come back to take Ernie away? Keep your mirrors covered, if nothing else, when listening to this story. After getting spooped in story one, Dan takes up back to Japan to investigate multiple ghost sightings in the wake of the 2011 tsunami. These aren't your average ghosts who hide in the shadows. No. These ghosts are in plain sight, they look like they are alive, just like you and I.\u00a0  \u00a0  Lynze balances out the more traditional stories with two stories that may just get under your skin. To start, Lynze takes us on a hike and camping. When you are in the middle of nowhere with no one else close by, except your tent mate, and screams cut through the night air, you might not want to trust that those screams are human. For the last story of the show, we follow along one sisters journey of watching \"the man\" who seemed to be attached to her brother, until the end. Was the man death, coming for her brother or was he there to warn of death to come? One will never know.\u00a0  New Merch: Another reminder for the April 22nd Scared to Death LIVE show.

Thanks to your support, we\u2019ll be donating over $12,500 dollars to help those in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana as they continue to work on their recovery from winter storm Uri [yuri].   The SBP, the more funds they receive, the more they will be able to assist in helping low income home owners, who generally have the least amount of access to resources. SBP volunteers are on-the-ground right now in Houston and southwest Louisiana repairing damage caused by burst pipes for those impacted by the storm, providing mucking, gutting and mold remediation services, replacing drywall, repairing damaged pipes, and so much more.

She could go in there and see what was happening\u2026. Angela got up and crept out to the hall. Standing in front of her daughter's door, she heard something\u2026 It was almost two in the morning.  And then she heard it more clearly - a low, heavy chanting. And then that same laugh, the laugh from before. Angela felt sick all of a sudden.   Some sweat slipped down Angela\u2019s back. She reached out her hand to open the door and as she curled her fingers around the doorknob, she abruptly withdrew them - the doorknob was red hot. She stifled her scream. \"  Do you know the legend of Moll Dyer, the inspiration for The Blair Witch Project? Moll was \u201can old hag,\u201d according to folklorists, who lived in a ramshackle home. Something about her terrified the local people - her uncommon height, her uncomfortably intense, piercing eyes.  Locals thought she was a witch. Was she? Or just another victim of paranoid persecution? After experiencing Moll Dyer, stick around to explore the ghost ships that show up on the coast of Japan every year. We\u2019ve talked about ghost ships on Scared to Death before.  Even skeptics who don\u2019t believe in ghost ships, who find a ship\u2019s crew completely missing or a ship showing up with a dead crew, to be pretty unsettling. So much of the vast oceans of the world are still unexplored - and often so empty - so devoid of human life.  You can easily end up being the only person around, nothing on the horizon for as far as the eye can see. What is happening on the coast of the Ichikawa Prefecture?  Lynze has a tale this week that is beyond scary. A story about the lamp postman. Who is he? What is he doing out there, just standing there in the night? When Meg pulls into the driveway late at night, should she make a run for the back door, while he watches or should she circle the block and see if he goes away? What will Meg do? In Lynze's second tale, we travel to La Jolla, CA to go for a deep-sea dive. It's not what might be lurking in the dark waters that you should fear but rather who?\u00a0When three divers go down but only two come out of the water, you will wonder what happened to diver number three.\u00a0  UPCOMING LIVE SHOW!

They were found unconscious and locked in a small boiler room in the southeastern part of the plant.   None of them could explain exactly what had happened to them. But all three agreed they\u2019d been approached by a man they didn\u2019t know shortly before they blacked out. A man whose skin appeared badly burned and who angrily shouted at them \u201cto push some steel.\u201d  What if your workplace was haunted? What if the ghost haunting your work was a former boss and he meant you harm? That is the story Dan weaves in his first half of episode 82. Dan takes us to Alabama to hear the story of the supposedly haunted Sloss Furnaces factory and their most famous resident ghost, James \"Slag\" Wormwood. For the second story of the first half of the show, Dan takes us over to Rhode Island to hear the story of a young woman so riddled with guilt to keeps trying to contact the dead to gain forgiveness. This particular story was reported to Ed and Lorraine Warren's New England Society for Psychic Research, back in the late '50s. When two young friends experience a tragedy while playing on the jungle gym, one of the friends dies. As the years go by, who is haunted? Is it the friend who is living, dealing with the guilt, or is the deceased always trying to reach out?\u00a0  Going for a whole new fan base, Lynze tells a tale submitted by an LDS listener. While on a mission in Mexico, does this elder come into contact with a spirit while witnessing a possible possession?\u00a0 If so, could it be that this spirit has taken up residency with the elders who witnessed its banishment? Stay till the end for an interesting detail as told by another elder. Moving from Mexico to the middle of nowhere suburbia, Lynze transports us to a haunted station. When a young man is working the graveyard shift at the local radio station, of course, he invites his friends to come hang out. One of his friends wants to practice his musical talents and records his jam session. When he plays back the track to bathe in his greatness, he hears a lot more than just his rendition of \"Tom Sawyer\".\u00a0  Live Show Announcement! Quick LIVE show reminder.

Dan and Lynze welcome a VERY special guest, Mustafa Gatollori from A&E's Ghost Hunters!\u00a0  The episode begins with Dan sharing the tale of the Worley Hospital in Pampa, Texas. The iconic Worley Hospital has been abandoned for many years after originally being built in 1929 to accommodate the fast growing oil town. Two cousins decided to buy the building with hopes of turning it into a B&B. Those hopes and dreams come to a halt when both cousins begin to experience paranormal activity. Dan and Lynze will talk to Mustafa about how he and his team explored the hospital to try and help the cousins out.\u00a0  But before that happens, Dan has another frightening encounter in the Worley Hospital to share. Three young friends break into the old building after hearing tales of its haunted hallways for years. They don't last very long. Between the rats and the faint giggling of someone who isn't really there, the friends get their fill and make a run for it.\u00a0  After chatting with Mustafa, Lynze takes us back to our usual content. She has two stories this week. The first story is told by a fan who thought she and her friends were just making up an imaginary friend only to find out they may have brought something else to life. Listen to the story of Emily Rose (not that one). From there, Lynze exposes us to a new piece of Mexican folklore. The tale of a Lechuzas Brujas! Supposedly, these are women who sell their souls to the devil to gain super natural powers but the price is that you become an owl. Hear the story of one families close encounter with the Lechuzas Brujas.\u00a0  Thank you for continuing to send in your stories, Creeps and Peepers!   Please keep doing so.

The doctor had been awakened several times by a gentle tickling sensation on his feet in the middle of the night. In his sleepy state he was convinced that the comforter or the sheets were somehow responsible for the sensation of something lightly brushing his feet. But then, the final time it occurred, he looked down to distinctly see a little girl tickling his feet.   He said she smiled and then vanished.\"  Could you spend a night in most haunted city in the United States, Savannah, Georgia? Could you spend a night in the most haunted city at a haunted hotel? If you said yes, congratulations, you are 100% Creeper. Dan goes old school with two tales of haunted houses, back to back, in Savannah. The first story takes place at The Hampton Lillibridge House, which partially set the stage for Tale of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. A really bizarre story with many deaths that lead up to one final, incredibly questionable death. Then, we stay put in Savannah to hear about the children that haunt The Marshall Hotel. A beautifully restored hotel that seems to have a lot more to offer than just a place to rest your head. Be wary of rooms 214,314 414!!  Lynze also goes back to her horror roots with a traditional story, telling the tale of a haunted house in Scotland. A young child has multiple encounters within their home but everything seemed friendly. That is, until one day, when the young child finds themself face to face with a floating being. After Scotland, we explore the idea of a new kind of spoop. Do you think shadow animals are possible? If shadow people are real, then why not a shadow dog? Or an animal doppelg\u00e4nger?\u00a0  Thank you for continuing to send in your stories, Creeps and Peepers!   Please keep doing so.

And you were mentioned. Long story short, you were supposed to be the payment made to whatever we\u2019d brought into the world that night.   This guy was telling your mom that it was \u2018almost time,\u2019 and your mom\u2026. she seemed\u2026 OKAY with it all.\"  In episode 79, Dan has a story based on some lost footage and a story about sleeping with the dead.\u00a0  In story one, we hear the sad and tragic story of Peter, a young boy who loses his parents and is sent to live with his grandparents. Upon turning 16, Peter's grandparents give him six tapes that contain footage he was not prepared for. Peter's father had prerecorded a series of 6 tapes that contain very important instructions for Peter to follow, in order to keep him safe. In each tape, Peter must recite a prayer for protection. Or is it? Are his dad's intentions simple and pure: leave a message for his son from beyond the grave? Tune in to hear Peter's side of the story.\u00a0  Dan's second tale is a well-documented and bizarre story. When a man's wife passes away unexpectedly, he isn't quite ready to say goodbye. Is he possessed by the spirit of his wife? Has she compelled him to ignore his vow of till death do us part so that they might be together... forever?  A doppelg\u00e4nger double feature wraps up the back half of the show. Lynze attempts to get under Dan's skin by talking about two very different but very disturbing instances of possible doppelg\u00e4nger encounters. In her first story, she tells the tale of a young girl and her grandmother both witnessing and talking to her younger brother. When he vanishes into thin air, both assume he's playing games. As the evening progresses and the young boy is still unable to be located, fear sets in. It's only after the boy's mother confirms that the young boy is at his father's that both grandma and granddaughter come to realize that they may have encountered something not of this world.\u00a0  Was there a glitch in the matrix or did a doppelg\u00e4nger appear before a man, posing as his wife? When the young husband wakes up to see his wife scurrying off to the restroom, he doesn't think much of it, until he notices her stilted stride. Upon further investigation, his wife is nowhere near the bathroom. How did she get to the bedroom without him knowing? Was she there all along? And if she was in the bedroom, who was that that went into the bathroom?\u00a0  Thank you for continuing to send in your stories, Creeps and Peepers!   Please keep doing so.

A few days later, the nurse called them again.\u00a0 This time, she reported seeing an apparition on the back stairs that \u201cchattered its teeth at her\u201d before completely disappearing into the darkness.\"  Dan and Lynze keep the scares coming in this 78th episode of Scared To Death! Dan has the strangest story to kick off episode. It's not what you think and the twist at the end just about sent Lynze over the edge. This story will give you a whole new set of fears. That sound in your attic, might not be what you think it is. And that thing you thought you saw out of the corner of your eye, might not be an apparition. In Dan's second tale, a terrible tragedy seems to be the base for a very haunted former school building in Canada. The building has since been transformed into modern condo's. Are the ghosts of the past haunting the current residents?  Lynze brings three juicy tales to her side of the episode. In her first story, we explore the idea that ghosts can be jealous and interfere in our most intimate moments. The story of Brenda and Doug is one that makes you really reconsider your most vulnerable moments. In her second story, Lynze gets all together too excited to try to scare Dan with one helluva creepy clown story! Oh, it's so juicy and will have you hiding all of your dolls. Lastly, in story three, a strange situation in which three people confirm the same thing, never knowing about the other's experiences. How does the evil from the other side seep into our lives?\u00a0  Thank you for continuing to send in your stories, Creeps and Peepers!   Please keep doing so.

And if you do, good luck getting back out\u2026\"  Dan tells two really amazing stories this week! To kick off the episode, we are off to sunny Los Angeles to the very famous Griffith Park. Is the park haunted? Cursed? Dead bodies have been found on the park grounds somewhat regularly and frequent tragedies lead us to believe that the grounds are a unique place to find many spoopy incidents, but can it be proved? What if you saw a Merry-Go-Round moving on its own, late into the night, with no explanation? Would that be proof enough? Listen to part one of this episode to find out! Next up, Hellmouth! What?! Did you know there are supposedly 7 mouths of Hell? This was all news to Dan and Lynze as they explored the story of Stull, Kansas. Does the Devil himself appear here on Halloween? Is this a portal to Hell? If you find this supposed portal, time moves at supernatural speed and you enter into some kind of trance. Find out what happens to a few people when they come out of the trance and realize how much time has gone by.\u00a0  On the backside of the episode, Lynze has an intense story coming in from a fan who is also a Paranormal Investigator--and so were his parents!\u00a0 It does not get more legit than this!! The story takes all of the right twists and turns and leaves you wanting to know more. In story number two, the question is raised within a family, if their house is haunted or if a family member is haunted!\u00a0  Thank you for continuing to send in your stories, Creeps and Peepers!

Dan told a very well documented story that would not traditionally fall under the paranormal category but then again, maybe it does. A couple buys a new home, their dream home in fact, only to find out that someone else does not want them to be there. Or do they want them to be there so they can get the \"young blood\" of their children? The story is terrifying, overwhelming and will add a new reason to be scared.  In the second story, Dan goes back to a more traditional story as he shares the tale of a possible shadow person. When a family is certain that they all live in a haunted house, it's really hard to ignore the possibility of a shadow person that can be confirmed by family members and friends alike.\u00a0  Lynze has two stories that somehow feel connected, carrying on the theme of shadow people and what lurks in the dark. In story one, she tells us about a truck driver who has an odd situation arise at his home, after a long day at work. Was that his wife? What happened to his dog? Then, the next story will have you wondering more about attachments. Fan and friend of the show, Ryan, has a long and on going encounter with something or someone.\u00a0\u00a0  Thank you for continuing to send in your stories, Creeps and Peepers!

And then, when I was about half-asleep, laying on my side facing the window, it felt like someone crawled into bed behind me. As I started to wake up and roll over, not really expecting to see anyone, I felt hands on my upper back and I started to panic. I suddenly thought that someone else really was in my bed with me. My mind raced, wondering how they could have gotten in so quietly? Were they already hiding in the closet or something when I entered the room? Was I going to die?\"  The Salem Witch Trials, kind of. Dan explores the spirits who may still be hanging around, all these years later. He starts off with plenty of history about Salem and the Witch Trials, which is really quite fascinating. The locale of the story takes place in the Joshua Ward House AKA The Merchant Hotel, where you can tempt fate and stay the night. Would you dare to stay there and risk being strangled by a ghost?  From Salem, Dan takes us down to Georgia for a more salacious, sexy, steamy story about the Corpsewood Manor. If you let you kids listen to this show and you have any qualms about sex, you might want to skip this one! We hear the story of Dr. Charles Scudder and his bizarre departure from his \"normal\" life and the hedonistic life he seeks. A chicken coup, a sex dungeon and wild orgies seem to be at the center of this bizarre story where true crime and horror tales collide.\u00a0  During Lynze's portion of the episode, she lighten's things up a tiny bit with a creepy but funny story about a possible cult sighting. The story itself takes place in the deep woods of Atlanta, Michigan which may conjure up memories of Dice Rd. What happens when you mix booze, teenagers and cultiness?  For her second story, we travel to Hawaii. Lynze reveals that she thinks Hawaii might be one of the most spiritual places in the US, due to the Polynesian culture. Also, she wonders if Pearl Harbor and the mass casualties have caused additional activity here. Those thoughts aside, this story presents what appears to be a modern day possession.\u00a0  Thank you for continuing to send in your stories, Creeps and Peepers!   Please keep doing so.

Shopify was founded in 2004 by Tobi L\u00fctke and Scott Lake around their original problem of why it's so hard to build an online business when they struggled to open an online snowboard equipment store. Today, Shopify's goal is to make commerce better for everyone, and it's used by more than 2 million merchants to run their online businesses. It's essentially an on-ramp for people looking to sell online.\u00a0 \u00a0 To help us break down Shopify, I'm joined by co-host Zack Fuss and our guest Alex Danco, who works on the Money team at Shopify. \u00a0 To really understand Shopify, you have to understand its different business units -- Core, Merchant Services, Ecosystem, and the new Shop platform -- and the role they each play in making commerce easier and better for merchants. We begin this breakdown by covering each of those business units and how they compare to Apple's business lines. We then dive deep into how Shopify makes money through the first and second derivative of their merchant success and how Shopify thinks about friction in e-commerce. We close with an incredible analogy of Shopify and StarCraft and the tools that Shopify has built into the still-nascent world of e-commerce. \u00a0 For the full show notes, transcript, and links to mentioned content, check out the episode page  here. ----- This episode is brought to you by Tegus.

We also discuss Kanyi\u2019s experience teaching the Design Your Life class at Stanford and how some of those principles convinced him to take the leap to start his own fund. I hope you enjoy my conversation with Kanyi Maqubela. \u00a0 For the full show notes, transcript, and links to mentioned content, check out the episode page  here. ------ This episode is brought to you by Tegus.

After that they get into news from around league over the past couple of days, including Steph Curry going on an unbelievable eight-game tear (19:34), the Celtics continuing their hot streak by whooping the Lakers (22:30), and Deandre Ayton\u2019s big game against the Kings (31:15). Then they lament the failed win-now moves made by the Chicago Bulls and Sacramento Kings that have ultimately amounted to a bunch of losses and, potentially, uncertainty in their star players' minds that those organizations will ever be stable enough to win (37:33). Finally, they touch on Luka Doncic\u2019s magical game-winning shot against the Grizzlies (53:00) and LaMarcus Aldridge\u2019s retirement (58:20).
